# Cat detector

## Introduction

Ths is my attempt to reproduce results from the Viola Jones 
paper applied to cat detection. The idea was to estimate the gap
between the paper and a new working implementation on another use cas


## Details

1. Download data to workspace (CAT_WORKSPACE)
2. Create dataframe from downloaded folders
3. Visualisation images from the dataframe
4. Training
    1. Extract positive patches from images
    2. For each stage
        1. Extract negative patches (GT and for cascade) from images
        2. Learn Haar model via random search of haar feature
        3. Update cascade zith new model
5. Testing
    1. Generate image visualisation with detected cat and other detection
    
    
# TODO

## Package architecture

- [X] CLI
- [ ] Download original data script
- [X] Python packaging
- [X] create config management ( dotenv and ini file)
- [ ] add debug tools
- [X] Ergonomy of cascade filter : replace the cascade by an ensemble where at least 80% of the classifiers should return true 

## Machine learning related

- [ ] Use hierarchical clustering
- [ ] Use Outlier detection to remove unwanted samples (filter some negative examples)
- [ ] Logging + Log visu + Log perf --> check mlflow?
- [ ] Add data augmentation

3 objectifs:
- Train a correct classifier
- pip install + URL ready to predict

Random Ideas: 

- Setup image providers + with labels + with masks. provider from_path, from_folder, from_pattern, from_scan
    Simple with one out img but also (img, int), (img, mask) 
- Use one stage object detector problem formulation. Use centerness prediction. 
- Create new run with correct window size.
- Add non square window search.
